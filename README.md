Working with a website using the wordpress engine. It is possible to change the content of the site using the wordpress admin panel.

With the help of the wordpress engine, the training site of the auto repair shop in the city of Volgograd was finalized. The site is based on the existing html markup, which was in the public domain.
The essence of the work was so that a potential customer using the WordPress admin panel could edit the content of the site: change the logo, images, text information in different places on the site. At the same time, he would not need to change the code in the editor.
Site files are uploaded to hosting, where an admin panel and a user with administrator rights are created. He changes the content of the site at his own discretion.
